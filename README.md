## Build a Gym website as part of MS Project 1 (March 2021)

### Booterstown Fitness - Your local fitness partners in South County Dublin
For my first Milestone Project i decided to build a website for an imaginary gym/fitness club, based in Booterstown, Co Dublin. 

#### User Stories
As a prospective client I want to find out more about this gym/fitness club: its location, its opening hours, its membership options, its classes, its prices,
its parking facilities and i would also like to view photos from the club to give me an indication of its facilities' quality. This would help me decide whether 
this gym offers good value for money, covers my work-out needs and suits me to commit to a long-term membership.

As a current client I want to be able to easily find class schedules, pay for membership and extras so that I can maximise my available time for working out and 
getting the most out of my subscription.

As the site owner I want to attract new members and also facilitate my existing clients in conducting some of their activity online and also to advise them on the
club's procedures for booking classes, etc.
