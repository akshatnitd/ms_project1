## Project: MS Project 1 - Build a Gym Website (March 2021)

### Booterstown Fitness - Your local fitness partners in South County Dublin
For my first Milestone Project i decided to build a website for an imaginary gym and fitness club, based in Booterstown, Co Dublin. 

#### User Stories
As a prospective client I want to find out more about this establishment: its location, its opening hours, its membership options, its classes, its prices,
its parking facilities and i would also like to view photos from the club to get an indication of its facilities' range and quality. This would help me decide whether this gym offers good value for money, covers my work-out needs and whether it suits me to commit to a long-term membership. Easy to access links of the establishment's social media pages would also be welcome as they can provide additional info on the above.

As a current client I want to be able to easily find the organised classes schedule, pay for my membership and extras so that I can maximise my available time for working out and getting the most out of my subscription. I also want to have quick access to the business' contact details for when i am on the go and need to get in touch with them.

As the site owner I want to attract new members by providing information that would entice them to do so. I also want to facilitate my existing clients in being able to pay for their membership online, and in as few user steps as possible. In addition, I want to advise clients on the club's procedures for booking classes, provide them with links to my business' social media pages, and finally, I want to have a photo gallery to provide additional motivation to members to sign-on for classes and use the gym facilities.
